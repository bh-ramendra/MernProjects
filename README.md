## 10th Project :- Ten-Gitfirebase Application
"GitHub Repo Search App", a web application which can be used to fetch details of a particular user on GitHub along with all it's public repositories. For this, I've used the github API for requesting and extracting details such as name, location, availability, etc.

Sign in/Sign up procedures are handled through Firebase , a new user must sign up first and can sign in then using the same username and password.

Things I have learned:--
1. Conditional rendering
2. React router
3. Configuring firebase for authentication.
4. Handling APIs
